# widgetsPad

The Windows 11 text editor has been over-saturated by a multitude of features: AI assistants, excessive ribbon menus, and endless formatting gadgets that miss the mark of what a text editor should be. 
widgetsPad is taking the opposite approach: A minimalist, wxWidgets-based text editor that focuses on the core essentials, while remaining 100% open source so you can create an editor that refelcts your 
personality, work ethic, and needs. So if you're ready to swap complexity for simplicity, try widgetsPad.
